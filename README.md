## Description

Welcome to my Chess Game project! This project is a fully functioning chess game built to replicate the classic game of strategy, intellect, and skill. The game follows the standard rules of chess, allowing two players to compete on an 8x8 board, moving pieces like pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and kings. The game tracks legal moves, check, checkmate, and stalemates, providing a premium experience for every that wants to play chess online.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Game Logic**: Custom implementation of chess rules
- **Animations**: Pygame
- **Version Control**: Git

## Motivation

This project was developed as a passion project to deepen my understanding of game development and algorithmic thinking. Chess, being a game with a rich history and deep complexity, was the perfect choice to challenge myself. The project also allowed me to explore various technologies and sharpen my skills in software development, problem-solving, and UI/UX design.

I am always trying to improve at every aspect of life, but mostly at programming. The university courses I have taken has thought me much, but I had never worked on such a complex project as this one before. I wanted to test my algorithmic thinking and OOP design skills with a project and my passion for both programming and chess brought me here. Chess, being a game with a rich history and deep complexity, was the perfect choice to challenge myself.

## Hurdles

I faced many hurdles while trying to finish the project. I had to refactor my code several times, changing some things entirely, while improving others. I was constantly trying to stick to DRY principles and writing elegant and clean code. These two things helped immensely and I could reduce the hurdles along the way, being able to go back to code I have written days before and easily catch on it was a pleasant experience and helped me a lot. Still making the En Passant and castle moves, work as they should was still a challenge, but I got through it.
